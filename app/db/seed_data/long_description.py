With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality.', 'long_description': 'Set against the backdrop of a seemingly idyllic farm, George Orwell\'s "Animal Farm" is a stunning allegorical tale that explores the corrupting influence of power. The story begins when the animals of Manor Farm, tired of their life under the oppressive regime of their human farmer, Mr. Jones, stage a successful rebellion, instigated by the boar Old Majorâs dream of an egalitarian society. The animals establish a democratic system based on equality, unity, and communal control of the farm. The pigs, being the most intelligent animals, assume the leadership roles, spearheaded by the crafty and charismatic pigs, Snowball and Napoleon.\n\nHowever, as the narrative unfolds, the utopian dream quickly deteriorates. Napoleon usurps power through cunning and ruthless tactics, driving Snowball away, and instigating a totalitarian regime under the guise of the animalâs original ideals. The Seven Commandments of Animalism, initially established to guide the animals, are gradually manipulated to justify Napoleon\'s selfish actions. The animals, once unified in their pursuit for freedom, find themselves entrapped in a cycle of exploitation and deceit, no better than their previous life under human control.\n\n"Animal Farm" is a masterful critique of political manipulation and a powerful exploration of the complexities of freedom, equality, and tyranny. The taleâs timeless relevance and Orwell\'s poignant symbolism make it an essential read for those interested in understanding the dynamics of power and the dangers of unchecked authority.

Their endless waiting, punctuated by their comical and philosophical exchanges, mirrors the human condition, weaving together a tale of despair, hope, and the relentless passage of time.\n\nIn this timeless piece of absurdist theatre, the wait for Godot becomes a metaphor for the often futile human quest for meaning and certainty.
